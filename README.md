This repository contains real-world, interview-level Data Analyst tasks designed for mastering SQL joins, Excel pivot analysis, and Pandas data manipulation.
The tasks reflect high-probability questions asked in top companies such as Amazon, Uber, Flipkart, Swiggy, Ola, Porter, and Meesho.

The project includes three interconnected datasets (Orders, Customers, Products) that allow you to practice joins, window functions, aggregations, case studies, and advanced analytics—exactly like real business scenarios.

📁 Dataset Files
File	Description
Orders.csv	600+ order records with timestamps, statuses, and amounts
Customers.csv	Customer details including region and signup date
Products.csv	Product categories, unit prices, and product metadata

Each dataset is intentionally created with realistic variations such as cancelled orders, regional distribution, and multi-category products.
